# DarkRP-addon
A small little script I made for DarkRP (Garry's Mod gamemode) before my dreams of running a Garry's mod server were crushed

When you die, the script collects all your weapons, makes you invincible, and removes collisions so that you're effectively
just a ghost. When you decide that you'd like to shoot people again, you press F2, your weapons are given back to you and
damage is re-enabled.

The script does this for every single person on the server.

I made this a long time ago for my Garry's Mod server back when it still worked. I have nothing really left to do with it now,
other than to display it to the world, because at the time, I was super proud of it. It was the first thing that I made in Lua.
